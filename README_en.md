# uni-app vue3 tailwindcss Template

[Chinese Document](./README.md) | [Principle](./PRINCIPLE.md)


This is a template that uses `vue3` to develop `uni-app`, assisted by a small program customized `tailwindcss`

Due to the limitation of `postcss 7.x` in `@vue/cli-service` `4.x` version, 

So the version of `@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat` is used to be compatible with `Postcss7`
